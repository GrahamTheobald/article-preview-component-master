# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component solution

This is a solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

I opted for a mobile first approach. I tried to keep the html structure relatively simple because I feel that I often
tend to over-complicate things and have far too many nested divs.
I used SASS for the styling which helped get a visual bearing on what it is I am styling because you can nest the
stylings similarly to how you nest html elements.
Afterwards I implemented the javascript.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about SASS. I also learned how to go about naming classes in a manner that keeps the name spacing of the
project clear and makes working with said classes in SASS efficient.
I learned how to contemplate structures that make transitioning from mobile display to desktop display as simple and
seamless as possible

### Continued development

I will continue developing SASS skills and working on efficient html structures
